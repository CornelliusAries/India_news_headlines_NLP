# Project description:
[OUTDATED] Based on the headline_text column provided by the dataset India News Headlines Dataset, determine what emotions may be associated with this article - Sentiment analysis.

Due to dataset issues we decided to change it for Sentimental Analysis for Tweets dataset which is a similar NLP problem.
## Goal of the project
Based on the "message to examine" column provided by the dataset, determine if author of the tweet is depressed or not.

## Project framework
In this project we plan to use PyTorch Transformers, which is a library of state-of-the-art pre-trained models for Natural Language Processing (NLP).

## Dataset
This dataset consists of 10282 unique tweets from both depressed and not depressed people.
