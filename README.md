## Project framework
In this project we plan to use PyTorch Transformers, which is a library of state-of-the-art pre-trained models for Natural Language Processing (NLP).

## Dataset
This news dataset is a persistent historical archive of noteable events in the Indian subcontinent from start-2001 to end-2020, recorded in real-time by the journalists of India. It contains approximately 3.4 million events published by Times of India.
